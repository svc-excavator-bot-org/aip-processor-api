    Add jar publishing

    The newly open sourced `aip-orchestrator` repository requires the generated source and classes from this repository. It used to publish an all-inclusive jar, but was recently updated to publish only a tarball for use with the AIP SDK. However, publishing a jar would also be helpful (and required) for the `aip-orchestrator` now.
